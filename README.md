# Urban-Heat-Islands-and-Supercells

This is a repository for a literature review project in METR 3334 at the University of Oklahoma.

**Topic:** The Impacts of Urban Heat Islands on Supercells

**Key Findings:**

***What are Urban Heat Islands (UHIs)?***


***How do UHIs impact Supercells?***

**Code:** Reproduced Figure of Maximum Reflectivity Values during a thunderstorm over Omaha, Nebraska's UHI, included from Sean T. Campbell's journal "Urban heat island enhancement to deep moist convection over Omaha, Nebrasa, in late June and early July of 2008."

**Further Research (Capstone):** Conduct additional case studies into UHI-induced convection, particularly tornadic events to uncover how to incorporate UHIs into the forecasting process for severe weather.

**Research Question:** How do UHIs impact the environment for supercellular development? Do UHIs enhance the likelihood of tornadoes?
