# Urban-Heat-Islands-and-Supercells

This is a repository for a literature review project in METR 3334 at the University of Oklahoma.

## Topic: The Impacts of Urban Heat Islands on Supercells

## Key Findings:

### What are Urban Heat Islands (UHIs)?
*Key Characteristics:*
* increased surface temperatures, ranging from 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than surrounding rural areas
* increased water vapor residence time
* heat and aerosol emissions

*Why do we care about them?* <br>
They occur in several major U.S. cities, exacerbating intense heat waves and storms throughout the year. This wreaks havoc on society, including the advancement of the economy and health of citizens, especially when little cooling occurs during the overnight hours of hot summers.

### How do UHIs impact Convection?
The strength of updrafts depend on the intensity of UHIs heating region and wind speeds. As heating amplitude increases, the time required for rainwater to accumulate decreases significantly. Higher surface temperatures provide a greater chance for rainfall, according to dry and moist convective simulations conducted by Baik et al. (2001).

### Do UHIs have any impact on Tornado Density?
There is little understanding about the interaction between UHIs and supercellular convection, especially tornadoes. In general, tornado density is approximately 1.85 times higher in metropolitan areas than in the most densely populated non-metro areas (Cusack, 2014). What is known, though, is that UHIs have a more significant role in influencing supercells as they move over a city, which may contribute to increased tornado density.

## Code
Reproduced Figure of Maximum Reflectivity Values during a thunderstorm over Omaha, Nebraska's UHI, included from Sean T. Campbell's journal "Urban heat island enhancement to deep moist convection over Omaha, Nebrasa, in late June and early July of 2008." This is titled "Homework #3" in the repository.

## Further Research (Capstone)
Conduct additional case studies into UHI-induced convection, particularly tornadic events to uncover how to incorporate UHIs into the forecasting process for severe weather.

## Research Question
How do UHIs impact the environment for supercellular development? Do UHIs enhance the likelihood of tornadoes?
