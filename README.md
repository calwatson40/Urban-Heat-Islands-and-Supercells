# Urban-Heat-Islands-and-Supercells

This is a repository for a literature review project in METR 3334 at the University of Oklahoma.

**Topic:** The Impacts of Urban Heat Islands on Supercells

**Key Findings:**

***What are Urban Heat Islands (UHIs)?***
*Key Characteristics:*
* increased surface temperatures, higher than surrounding rural areas
* increased water vapor residence time
* heat and aerosol emissions

***WHAT***


***Do UHIs have any impact on Tornado Density?***

There is little understanding about the interaction between UHIs and supercellular convection, especially tornadoes. In general, tornado density is approximately 1.85 times higher in metropolitan areas than in the most densely populated non-metro areas (Cusack 2014). What is known, though, is that UHIs have a more significant role in influencing supercells as they move over a city, which may contribute to increased tornado density.

**Further Research (Capstone):** Conduct additional case studies into UHI-induced convection, particularly tornadic events to uncover how to incorporate UHIs into the forecasting process for severe weather.

**Research Question:** How do UHIs impact the environment for supercellular development? Do UHIs enhance the likelihood of tornadoes?
